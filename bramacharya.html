    <h1>Brahmacharya</h1>
  <p> Brahmacharya (/ˌbra mətʃʌrjə/; Sanskrit: ब्रह्मचर्य lit.'pure conduct') is a concept within Indian religions that literally means to stay in conduct within one's own Self. In Yoga, Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism it generally refers to a lifestyle characterized by sexual continence or complete abstinence<br>
    brahmacharya, (Sanskrit: “pure conduct”) in Buddhism, strictly, the practice of sexual chastity; more generally, the term denotes the endeavour by monks and nuns as well as lay devotees to live a moral life as a way to end suffering and to reach enlightenment<br>
    Brahmacharya is traditionally regarded as one of the five yamas in Yoga.</p>
